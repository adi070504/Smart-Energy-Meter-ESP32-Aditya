# Smart-Energy-Meter-ESP32-Aditya
This project monitors real-time electricity usage using an ESP32 and sensors. It measures voltage and current, calculates energy consumption, estimates electricity cost, and detects abnormal power usage. The system uses Wi-Fi for monitoring and can be extended for smart energy management.
